# Project Documentation Index

This folder centralizes project guides and summaries that were previously scattered in the repository root. Consider moving the existing Markdown files here to keep the root clean.

Suggested files to relocate:
- ADMIN_CONTROLS_GUIDE.md
- ADMIN_FEATURES_GUIDE.md
- ADMIN_MENU_GUIDE.md
- AUTHENTICATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- EDITOR_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- ERROR_TRACKING_GUIDE.md
- FINAL_RENDERING_FIXES.md
- FORMATTING_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- GLOBAL_ADMIN_MENU_GUIDE.md
- IMAGE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md
- LOGO_ADMIN_MENU_GUIDE.md
- MODERNIZATION_SUMMARY.md
- PAGES_CONTENT_SUMMARY.md
- PAGES_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- PASSWORD_RESET_SETUP.md
- RENDERING_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
- SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md

Once moved, update any references in README and scripts.
